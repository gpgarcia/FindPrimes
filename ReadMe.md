# Programming Challenge: Find Primes 

## Problem
Implement the IPrime interface, that has a method _IsPrime(n)_ that returns true if a number n < N is prime.

The IPrime interface has 3 members. The property N which is the upper limit of the search space. The _Initialize()_ method to do any setup required by the algorithm you choose. 

Included is also a helper class that implement some utility methods used in the testing.

To help illustrate what is needed the class Definition is provided. This class uses the definition of a prime number for the implementation.

Finally, there is a Benchmark class that helps you evaluate the performance of your implementation.

## Objective
The definition class does not perform well. It is glacially slow. Can you do better?

Complimentary to this is how high a value of N can you use and perform the test in a reasonable amount of time.

## Challenge
1. Clone this Repo to your machine.
1. Develop your implementation. Include your name or initials in the class name.
1. Submit your class via email.
1. The best performing implementations will be announced.
1. At end of challenge all submissions will be checked into this repo.
